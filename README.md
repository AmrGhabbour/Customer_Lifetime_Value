# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

This project uses machine learning techniques and the **lifetimes** Python library to predict the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** for a business based on historical transaction data. CLV is a crucial metric for businesses to understand how much revenue a customer will generate over their relationship with the company. By predicting CLV, businesses can make better decisions in customer segmentation, marketing, and retention strategies.

## Project Overview

This project builds a predictive model to calculate the **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** of customers using transaction history. The model leverages the **BetaGeoFitter** and **GammaGammaFitter** models from the **lifetimes** Python library to predict customer behavior, including:
- The number of future purchases.
- The expected value of those purchases.
- The overall customer lifetime value.

The project also segments customers based on their CLV and transaction behavior using **KMeans clustering**.

### Key Steps in the Project:
1. **Data Preparation**: Data is preprocessed to calculate the core metrics of recency, frequency, and monetary value.
2. **Model Training**:
   - **BetaGeoFitter**: To predict the number of future purchases.
   - **GammaGammaFitter**: To predict the monetary value of purchases.
3. **CLV Prediction**: Combining both models to calculate the predicted CLV for each customer.
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Using **KMeans clustering** to segment customers based on their predicted CLV and transaction behavior.
5. **Visualization**: Boxplots and clustering visualizations to show the distribution of CLV across different segments.



## Data Description

The project uses the `sales_transactions.csv` file, which contains the following columns:

- **invoice_id**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **date**: Date and time of the transaction.
- **Customer_id**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **item_id**: Unique identifier for each item purchased.
- **quantity**: Number of items purchased in the transaction.
- **Item_Price**: Price of a single item.
- **Value**: Total monetary value of the transaction.

### Sample Data:
```plaintext
invoice_id         date                    Customer_id   quantity   Value

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** for the programming language.
- **pandas** and **numpy** for data manipulation.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization.
- **lifetimes** for CLV modeling (BetaGeoFitter and GammaGammaFitter).
- **scikit-learn** for KMeans clustering and model evaluation.
- **yellowbrick** for visualizing the KMeans clustering elbow method.


## Model Building

### 1. Data Preprocessing
The `summary_data_from_transaction_data()` function generates key customer metrics:
- **Recency**: Time since the last purchase.
- **Frequency**: Number of purchases.
- **Monetary Value**: Total amount spent by the customer.

### 2. BetaGeoFitter Model (Beta-Geometric/Negative Binomial Distribution)
The **BetaGeoFitter** model predicts the future transaction frequency of a customer:
- Trains the model using recency, frequency, and time since first purchase.
- Predicts the number of transactions for each customer over a defined period.

### 3. GammaGammaFitter Model
The **GammaGammaFitter** model estimates the average transaction value for each customer:
- Predicts the expected monetary value per transaction.

### 4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
The final CLV prediction is calculated by combining the outputs from both models:
- **CLV = Predicted Number of Transactions Ã— Predicted Transaction Value**

### 5. Clustering
Using **KMeans** clustering, customers are grouped based on their predicted number of transactions, predicted transaction value, and CLV:
- The **KElbowVisualizer** is used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Customers are segmented into clusters based on these features.

### 6. Evaluation and Visualization
- **Boxplots** visualize the distribution of CLV across different customer clusters.
- Additional visualizations can be created for a deeper understanding of customer behavior.

## Results

After running the model, you will have:
1. Predicted CLV for each customer.
2. Customer segments grouped based on predicted CLV, number of transactions, and average transaction value.
3. Visualizations showing the distribution of CLV across customer clusters.

### Example Output:
- **Customer 12345**: Predicted CLV = $450
- **Customer 67890**: Predicted CLV = $950

The results can be further analyzed by comparing different customer segments to identify high-value customers.

## Usage

To predict CLV for new transaction data:

1. Replace the current data in `sales_transactions.csv` with new data.
2. Re-run the `Customer_LifeTime_Value.pynb` script to generate updated predictions and segmentation.

To experiment with different models or parameters:
- Modify the hyperparameters in `Customer_LifeTime_Value.pynb`.
